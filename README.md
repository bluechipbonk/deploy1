# 💎 BLUECHIP - The First *Truly Useless* Bluechip Memecoin on Solana

> "It’s not just a meme. It’s a mirror." – CT anon, 2025

**BLUECHIP** is a Solana-based memecoin engineered for irony, powered by BONK, and backed by the tears of sidelinoors. It’s the first *intentionally USELESS* coin that proves usefulness is overrated, and *memeability* is undervalued.

## 📜 Lore

Born from the ashes of every CT project dubbed “dead” at $4M, and resurrected through a 3,000% pump, **BLUECHIP** is the flagship for the new wave of meta-aware, anti-utilitarian memecoins. It doesn’t try to fix DeFi — it mocks it. And in doing so, becomes what others fail to: **inevitable**.
